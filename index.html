    About me:
    </p>
    </h2>
    <p>

      My name is Michelle Herrera I’m going to be a senior at James Lick High School this upcoming fall. I’m currently attending a program called Girls Who Code at Amazon in Sunnyvale. In my three years of high school I have played multiple sports such as soccer, volleyball, and softball. I’m interested in attending a UC and pursuing a major in the engineering field. Some fun facts about me are that I have a twin brother, I want to travel the world when I’m older, and I love dogs! I also love watching Netflix on my free time or I enjoy going on hikes when I have the time to do so. I am the youngest and I was born and raised in San Jose, California, but my parents are both from Mexico.
